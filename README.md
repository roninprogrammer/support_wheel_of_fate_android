an online “Support Wheel of Fate”. This should repeat selecting two engineers at random to both complete a half day of support (shift) each to ultimately generate a schedule that shows whose turn is it to support the business.

## What is it?
All engineers in Company X take it in turns to support the business for half a day at a time. 
Currently, generating a schedule that shows who’s turn is it to support the business is being done manually and we need to automate that!

#### The rules
- [x] There are only two support shifts per day, a day shift and a night shift.

UX/UI is up to you to decide; however, two following screens should be included:
